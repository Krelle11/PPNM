Call of 'add' method for genlist object
Right now nothing has been done, so the the 'size' of the array 'data' as given by size() is: 0 and more directly its length is: 0
Now the temporary array 'newdata' has been created. The method call 'size()' still returns the size of the 'data' array which is 0
But the length of the array 'newdata' should be 0 + 1, and it is in fact: 1
We are now at the end of the for-loop. All data has been copied from 'data' to 'newdata', and the input parameter 'item' (of type T) from the method header has been placed at the end
The size of 'newdata' thus is: 1
Now we have set the array 'data' equal to 'newdata' and so the size of 'data' as given by the method call 'size()' is: 1 and more directly the length of the array 'data' is: 1
Also the last object in 'data' is now 2 which is equal to the input parameter i.e to: 2
